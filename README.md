=============

A Massively Multiplayer Online Business Simulation Game for Android.

In a nutshell: We try to simulate real world condition in some case where people have to propose a proposal to bank to cover their expenses when creating new industries (from equipment, employees, storage, to raw materials [for several turns]). They’ve to return the money they borrowed from the bank on a specific time.

The industries are in linked chain (circulated in circle ways). People can interact with each other on the market; they can specify their own price on the product. People can choose where they want to live (there’s a region system, people can buy/sell their product from/to other region by import/export).

Every product including equipment and employee has their own quality rated from 1 star to 5, it’ll affect to the output product (using a matrix). Every industry can run no matter number of equipment that you run in factory, say it you must have about 2200 pumps to run an oil well, but with 200 pumps your industry can still run (ratio).

There’s another feature such as advertisement, etc. We’re trying to implement all marketing mix aspect on this research.
